# national-budget-simulator
Demo prorgam that simulates the Philippine National Budget while providing a rudimentary analysis for any changes to the budget allocation. Created for the class STS 1 THY-2 with Godot 3.3.2.

If you just want the simplified version containing the sliders and the pie chart, you can either check out the source code or, If I have the time (no promises!), release a separate version for that.
