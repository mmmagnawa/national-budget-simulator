# National Budget Simulator
Demo prorgam that simulates the Philippine National Budget while providing a rudimentary analysis for any changes to the budget allocation. Created for the class STS 1 THY-2 with Godot 3.3.2.

Check the releases for Windows and Android. Alternatively, check out the web build at https://mmmagnawa.github.io/national-budget-simulator/.

A preemptive warning: during development I did not consider functionality for older devices, so if you encounter any issues, I apologize but I do not have the time to test the build across multiple devices.

The Android release has been tested on a physical device but it might not work for devices running on old hardware or software. I have never worked with Android devices before, so I could not figure out how to fix these in time. Also, the web version may be primitive and require a lot of processing power, so it may cause older devices to freeze up. Instead, try out the most stable release, which is the Windows version (both for 32-bit and 64-bit systems).

If you're running the Windows version, make sure that you extract the .zip file first and keep both files in the same folder.

PS: If you just want the simplified version containing the sliders and the pie chart, you can either check out the source code or, If I have the time (no promises!), I will release a separate version for that.
